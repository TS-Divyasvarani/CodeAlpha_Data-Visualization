 Task 3 – Data Visualization:

Aim:
To represent raw data in the form of charts and graphs so that patterns and insights can be understood easily.

Dataset Used:
- `quotes_dataset.csv`
- If the file is not available, the program automatically creates a sample dataset.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

What This Task Does:

1. Transform Raw Data
- Converts text data (author names) into numerical values
- Counts number of quotes for each author

2. Create Visualizations
- Bar chart to compare number of quotes per author
- Pie chart to show percentage distribution of quotes

3. Improve Understanding
- Charts clearly show which author has more quotes
- Labels and titles make the visuals easy to read

4. Data Storytelling
- Insight is generated from the charts
- The author with the highest number of quotes is identified

5. Portfolio Ready Visuals
- Clean and simple charts
- Suitable for assignments and portfolio presentation

Output:
- Bar chart showing quotes per author
- Pie chart showing quote distribution
- Console output displaying key insights
